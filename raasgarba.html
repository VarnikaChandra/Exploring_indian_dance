    <h2>Introduction to Raas Garba</h2>
    <p>
      Raas Garba, or simply Garba, is a traditional folk dance from the state of Gujarat, India. It is a celebratory dance performed predominantly during the nine-night Hindu festival of Navratri. The dance is characterized by its spirited rhythm, flowing movements, and the use of colorful costumes. Garba is performed in a circular form, with dancers moving around a centrally lit lamp or a statue of the Goddess Shakti.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Roots</h2>
    <p>
      The term "Garba" comes from the Sanskrit word 'Garbha' meaning womb and 'Deep' meaning a small earthen lamp; together, they symbolize life just as a fetus in the womb and light. Traditionally, it was performed by women who used simple, synchronized steps to express devotion to Goddess Shakti. Over time, the dance has evolved to include men and is now performed on various festive occasions, blending intricate steps and vibrant music.

    <h2>Performance and Techniques</h2>
    <p>
      Garba is danced in a circle reflecting the Hindu view of time â€” the cycles of birth, life, death, and rebirth. The dance movements are performed around a centrally lit lamp or an image of the Goddess Shakti. Participants clap their hands or snap their fingers, with steps timed to the beat of the music, typically played by live musicians. The most common musical instruments used include the dhol (double-headed drum) and the harmonium.

      The dance starts with slow tempo and gradually builds up, allowing the dancers to transition smoothly into more complex patterns. Costumes for Garba are typically colorful, with women wearing embroidered choli, ghagra or sari, and men donning kediyu and turbans.
    </p>

    <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
    <p>
      Raas Garba plays a crucial role in Gujarati culture, promoting community participation and celebrating feminine divinity. It is not just a dance but an act of worship through joyful expression. While Garba nights during Navratri are the most famous, this dance form has gained international popularity, especially among the Gujarati diaspora, and is performed worldwide during different cultural and social gatherings.
