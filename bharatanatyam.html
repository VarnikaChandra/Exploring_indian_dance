    <h2>Introduction to Bharatanatyam</h2>
    <p>
      Bharatanatyam is a classical dance form from the southern state of Tamil Nadu in India. It is one of the oldest dance forms in India and is considered the mother of many other Indian classical dance forms. Historically a solo dance that was performed exclusively by women, it initiated in the Hindu temples of Tamil Nadu and eventually flourished in South India. The dance is known for its fixed upper torso, legs bent or knees flexed out combined with spectacular footwork, a sophisticated vocabulary of sign language based on gestures of hands, eyes, and face muscles.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Roots</h2>
    <p>
      The term "Bharatanatyam" traditionally refers to the dance form in the Tamil language and is believed to be derived from four expressions "Bha" - Bhava (expression), "Ra" - Raga (music), "Ta" - Tala (rhythm) and "Natyam" (dance) in Sanskrit. This dance form was nurtured in the temples and courts of southern India since ancient times and was performed by highly skilled artists known as 'devadasis' who dedicated their lives to serving the deity. 
    </p>

    <h2>Performance and Techniques</h2>
    <p>
      A typical Bharatanatyam performance follows a seven-part sequence of movements: Alarippu (introduction), Jatiswaram (a blend of dance and music), Shabdam (expression of lyrics), Varnam (a combination of expressive and technical dance), Padam (narrative), and Thillana (culminating performance). The technique of Bharatanatyam consists of 64 basic 'Adavus' (key dance units) that dancers string together to form a sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dance is accompanied by music that is typically Carnatic (from South India), and the dancer wears a tailored costume and adorned with jewelry that reflects the dance's rich tradition. The facial expressions, the hand gestures, and the exacting footwork articulate a narrative in rhythm and melody.
    </p>

    <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
    <p>
      Bharatanatyam has not only preserved its classical heritage but has also adapted to changing cultural contexts. With its wide range of movements and postures and the sheer beauty of the dance form, Bharatanatyam has become a symbol of the cultural heritage of India, attracting audiences and performers from around the globe. It plays a crucial role in the celebration of the annual Madras Music Season, a cultural event in Chennai that includes performances by hundreds of artists.
