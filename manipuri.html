    <h2>Introduction to Manipuri</h2>
    <p>
      Manipuri dance, originating from the northeastern state of Manipur in India, is one of the major Indian classical dance forms. It is particularly known for its Hindu Vaishnavism themes, and the exquisite performances of love-inspired dance drama of Radha-Krishna called Raslila. Manipuri encompasses a range of performances, from the traditional Pung Cholom, a drum dance, to elaborate tales depicted through graceful and subtle movements.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Roots</h2>
    <p>
      The roots of Manipuri dance are deeply embedded in the cultural traditions and religious beliefs of the region, closely associated with the indigenous Meitei people of Manipur. This dance form is intertwined with the religious practices and folk traditions of the state, which are reflected in the intricacies and spiritual expression of the dance. Historically, Manipuri dance has been a part of the ritualistic and artistic life of the Manipuris, and has been mentioned in ancient texts like the Bhagavata Purana.
    </p>

    <h2>Performance and Techniques</h2>
    <p>
      Manipuri is characterized by its smooth and undulating movements which give it a graceful and fluid character, distinct from other classical dance forms. The dancers do not wear ankle bells (a common feature in other Indian dances) and the feet movements are soft and gliding. The Pung Cholom, an integral part of the repertoire, showcases the art of drum playing where the dancer plays the Pung (a type of drum) while dancing.

    <p>
      The costumes for Manipuri dance are colorful and elaborate, with women dancers wearing a barrel-shaped long skirt that complements the aesthetic appeal of the dance form. The themes are mainly devotional and are performed during festivals and special occasions in Manipur. The music accompanying the dance includes classical ragas and talas, with instruments like the Pung, harmonium, and flutes.
    </p>

    <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
    <p>
      Manipuri dance is not just an artistic expression but also a spiritual homage to the divine. It plays a crucial role in the preservation and propagation of the cultural heritage of Manipur. The dance is a conduit for depicting the rich mythology of Radha-Krishna through its subtle yet expressive choreography and rhythmic complexities. Internationally, Manipuri dance has been a symbol of Indian culture and heritage, captivating audiences with its elegance and lyrical movements.
